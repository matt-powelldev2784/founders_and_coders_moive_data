## Moive Data

Movie data project built using HTML, Javascript and CSS. The data persists in local storage. It uses the
file reader api to read and store a movie image which can be uploaded when adding a new movie using a form.
I have defined logic to sort by number or text. Therefore I have provided ascending and descending sort
functionality by year, title and rating. I have used a utility function to help with code readability and
development speed, when creating dom elements. This site uses frequently uses dom manipulation toshow or
hide elements when navigating around.
