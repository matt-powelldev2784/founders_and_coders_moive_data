For this project, we’d like you to build a user interface, using HTML, and populate that with data from a
JavaScript object. We’ve given you a data object below.

Make this project your own, what you build as an interface and how you choose to display the data is up to you.

We’d like you to include ways for the user to interact with the data. For example, you might allow the user to
sort the movies by the year they were released, or add a new movie to the movieData object.

Movie data project built using HTML, Javascript and CSS. The data persists in local storage. It uses the
file reader api to read and store a movie image which can be uploaded when adding a new movie using a form.
I have defined logic to sort by number or text. Therefore I have provided ascending and descending sort
functionality by year, title and rating. I have used a utility function to help with code readability and
development speed, when creating dom elements. This site uses frequently uses dom manipulation toshow or
hide elements when navigating around.
